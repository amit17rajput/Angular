Angular is a development platform, built on TypeScript. As a platform, Angular includes:

i. A component-based framework for building scalable web applications
ii .A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more
iii .A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code

With Angular, you're taking advantage of a platform that can scale from single-developer projects to enterprise-level applications. Angular is designed to make updating as straightforward as possible, so take advantage of the latest developments with minimal effort. Best of all, the Angular ecosystem consists of a diverse group of over 1.7 million developers, library authors, and content creators.

Components : Components are the building blocks that compose an application. A component includes a TypeScript class with a @Component() decorator, an HTML template, and styles. The @Component() decorator specifies the following Angular-specific information:

A CSS selector that defines how the component is used in a template. HTML elements in your template that match this selector become instances of the component.

An HTML template that instructs Angular how to render the component

An optional set of CSS styles that define the appearance of the template's HTML elements
Angular's component model offers strong encapsulation and an intuitive application structure. Components also make your application painless to unit test and can improve the general readability of your code.
